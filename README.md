===============

idiot webview for Eclipse Mining Consortium mobile interface

---

is a simple web view with the option to specify the API key to be observed. 
It does nothing more. 
You can use a bookmark, is definitely faster, you do not have to download anything, you do not have to prepare the apk. Who makes you do a pull?
